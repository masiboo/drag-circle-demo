# Circle drag and drop task
## You can easily execute by docker-compose

Just  try following command
```sh
docker-compose up
```
You asked only to insert the circle coordinates to my desired database. I wanted to use Postgresql as a database. Also, implement it in the Angular frontend to retrieve all or selected coordinates. Anyway, it was something extra. But I added a console log to show after each insertion, the return value from the H2 database. 

PS: I explained the reason for my delay.
