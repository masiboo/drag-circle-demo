You asked only to insert the circle coordinates into my desired database. I wanted to use Postgresql as a database. Also, I wanted to implement data retrieval in the Angular frontend to retrieve all or selected coordinates. Anyway, it was something extra. But I added a console log to show after each insertion, the return value from the H2 database.  

PS: I explained the reason for my delay.
